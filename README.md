# Malware Analysis
This repository is used for uploading newest malware samples that I've found in the wild. Before you download/use these samples, read the warnings:

  - ***I don't take any responsibility***.
  - Know what you're going to do.
  - Use these as own risk.

# Contribution!
Want to contribute? Sure, you can help me find some new samples by sending me via:
  - [Facebook Messenger](https://m.me/ZeroUnix.error)
  - [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/TheZeroUnix)
  - [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Y3QdrtH)
  - Github (just open an issue)

**Note:** Since Facebook and Twitter have their malicious content filter, I recommend contributors to send samples via Github or my Discord server. Also, there are rules:
 - If you send malicious URLs, make sure to separate it for others not to misclick. (ex: www[.]malware[.]com/XXX)
 - I don't analyze **very out-dated samples**.
 - Any verified samples will be upload here and I'll start analyzing it.

Feel free to ask anything and contribute!
